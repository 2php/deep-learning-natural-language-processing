# What we are doing #

Have decided to now study towards learning multiple NLP, DL and ML techniques and build upon this knowledge. Then based on what we have learnt, create some cool NLP application, or maybe work towards breaking one of those NLP benchmarks.

# What of the project #

We have realised, that one week is enough to get stuff ready for showing to Mane, and the external project guy. So in case, nothing strikes till that time, we just get a few 100 lines of code and show it in the presentation like what we have been doing with mane all this long.


# Details #

So, now we look for online competitions, class homework assignments, other nlp/dl/ml applications which we can work upon and learn stuff.
