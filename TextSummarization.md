# Types of Summaries #


## Indicative vs Informative ##

Indicative -> Indicates the contents of the document so that the reader may then decide to read it or not

Informative -> Proper summary keeping the major details of the document


## Extractive vs Abstractive ##
Extractive -> Only extracts the major sentences of the document and reproduces it verbatim, So the task here is to identify the major sentences which would give a good idea of the entire content.

Abstractive -> Generating an abstract of the document

## Single Document vs  Multi Document ##
Multi Document -> Combining multiple documents into one
